Description: Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) is a computationally
    inexpensive algorithm to merge protein summaries from multiple experimental
    quantitative proteomics data. The algorithm connects two or more groups with
    overlapping accession numbers. In some cases, pairwise groups are mutually
    exclusive but they may still be connected by another group (or set of
    groups) with overlapping accession numbers. Thus, groups created by PGCA
    from multiple experimental runs (i.e., global groups) are called "connected"
    groups. These identified global protein groups enable the analysis of
    quantitative data available for protein groups instead of unique protein
    identifiers.
